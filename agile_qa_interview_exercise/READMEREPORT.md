The getVowelListWithCount methods IF statement, shouldnâ€™t have the equal sign >=4 since the feature mentioned should allow upto 4 input strings expected should be as below If(args.length() >=5){ System.out.println("Extra arguments passed."); return null; }
The setter and getert methods in CountResult Class are redundant never used
